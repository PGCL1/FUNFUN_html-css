Currently learning C in 42, I wanted to explore a bit the world of web development and see if I could start creating something of my own. I followed a Scrimba tutorial and was able to build:
* a Google Clone
* a personal website (https://timely-empanada-a69abd.netlify.app/) (it's a first step haha, I'll get better).

I learnt about lists (ordered and not), HTML document structure, links and hyperlinks, buttons, images and tags (head, body, anchor). This was fun, peace.
